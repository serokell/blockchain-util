-- | Change Accumulator is in-memory state of snowdrop's functions.
-- Most likely it should be consisnted with persistent state because it's just
-- one more layer of state which must be considered during access to state.
-- Also it has to be possible to apply ChangeSet to this Change Accumulator.

-- | Datatype describing read only interface for access to a state:
--
-- * Simple query, iteration
--
-- Type variables @id@, @value@ describe types of key and value of key-value storage.
-- Variable @res@ denotes result of 'DbAccess' execution.
data DbAccess conf (components :: [*]) (res :: *)
    = DbQuery (HSet components) (HMap components -> res)
    -- ^ Request to state.
    -- The first field is request set of keys which are requested from state.
    -- The second one is a callback which accepts result of request: Map key value
    -- and returns a continuation (a next request to state).

    -- ^ Iteration over state.
    -- The first field is prefix for iteration over keys with this prefix.
    -- The second one is used to accumulate entries during iteration.

--
-- * Simple query, iteration
-- * Ability to convert sequence of change sets to sequence of change accumulators
--
-- Monad in which 'DbAccessM' is executed is expected to provide method
-- to use change accumulator in order to alter accesses done with 'DbAccess'.

    -- (and might be a pure operation, e.g. for storage types that
    -- use 'SumChangeSet' as change accumulator).
    -- Some storage types though do require an access to internal state (e.g. AVL+ storage)
    -- due to more complicated structure of their respective change accumulator.
    --
    -- Operation's name "modify accumulator" refers to the fact that
    -- 'DbAccessM' is typically executed in monad with read access to internal
    -- change accumulator which modifies the actual state. To perform the

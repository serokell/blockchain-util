-- FoldF
------------------------

-- | FoldF holds functions which are intended to accumulate result of iteratio
-- over entries.
-- The first field is an initial value.
-- The second one is an accumulator.
-- The third one is convertor result of iteration to continuation (a next request to state).

-- It can't be defined Monoid instance for @FoldF@ because @mempty@ can't be defined.

------------------------
-- DbAccess
------------------------

-- | Datatype describing read only interface for access to a state.
-- By "access" it's meant any interation with any kind of external state,
-- including: in-memory, persistent etc.
-- @id@, @values@ describes types of key and value of key-value storage.
-- @chgAccum@ is in-memory state of snowdrop.
data DbAccess chgAccum (components :: [*]) (res :: *)
    = DbQuery (HSet components) (HMap components -> res)
    -- ^ Request to state.
    -- The first field is request set of keys which are requested from state.
    -- The second one is a callback which accepts result of request: Map key value
    -- and returns a continuation (a next request to state).

    -- This action doesn't imply an explicit access to state,
    -- but AVL tree requires this access. This operation is read only,
    -- so it doesn't affect passed @chgAccum@ and doesn't produce any changes id db.

------------------------
-- ERoComp
------------------------

-- | Change Accumulator is in-memory state of snowdrop's functions.
-- Most likely it should be consisnted with persistent state because it's just
-- one more layer of state which must be considered during access to state.
-- Also it has to be possible to apply ChangeSet to this Change Accumulator.

-- | Reader computation which allows you to query for part of bigger state
-- and build computation considering returned result.
-- DbAccess is used as an effect of BaseM.

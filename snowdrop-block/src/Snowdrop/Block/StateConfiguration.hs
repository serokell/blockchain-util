-- | Block handling configuration. Contains methods for to perform handling of block sequence (chain):
--
--  * load neccessary information from block storage,
--  * perform structural validation (using methods from `bscConfig :: BlkConfiguration`),
--  * apply validated sequence of blocks to current state and block storage.
--
--  Interface assumes two distinct storages to exist and be accessible via `m` monad:
--  block storage and state.
--
--  Block storage is used to store information required for block processing
--  (including tip block, currently adopted "best" chain), while state contains actual blockchain state
--  as result of application of currently adopted "best" chain on initial blockchain state.

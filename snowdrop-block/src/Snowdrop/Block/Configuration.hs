-- be performed as part of individual transaction validation (which is encapsulated in `bscApplyPayload`
-- method of block handling configuration `BlkStateConfiguration`.

    -- Normally to be represented by function to get header hash
    -- (with header including hashes of data within the block).

    -- ^ Get reference of the block preceding the block, which header is given.
    -- Returns `Nothing` in case of supplied header referring to the very first
    -- block of blockchain (a la block with difficulty 1).

    , bcBlkVerify    :: BlockIntegrityVerifier blkType
    -- ^ Block integrity verifier: a pure function which given a block returns True iff
    -- the block is valid with respect to its integrity.
    -- This includes checks of all invariants that rely on:
    --
    -- * particular order or relation between transactions in block;
    -- * existience or non-existence of particular transactions in block;
    -- * relation between block payload and header, e.g. header containing a hash of payload.

    -- all stateful checks shall be made in scope of validators for individual transactions.

    -- ^ Comparison of two chains.
    -- Left operand is the currently adopted "best" chain, right operand is a proposed
    -- chain. `bcIsBetterThan` function is to make up a decision on whether proposed block
    -- sequence is better (stronger) than currently adopted.
    --
    -- If `bcIsBetterThan` returns `True`,
    -- it means that if proposed chain is considered valid over the latter course of validation, it
    -- is to be applied instead of currently adopted "best" chain.

    , bcValidateFork :: OSParams blkType -> OldestFirst [] (BlockHeader blkType) -> Bool
    -- ^ Check of chain with OS Params.

    , bcMaxForkDepth :: Int
    -- ^ Parameter denoting the maximal depth of Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two chains in
    -- the currently adopted "best" chain.
    -- First block of proposed chain is assumed to have previous block reference to be an
    -- existing block in the currently adopted "best" chain (which is called an LCA of two chains).
    --
    -- If the LCA block is more than `bcMaxForkDepth` blocks behind the most recent block of
    -- currently adopted "best" chain, the proposed chain is considered invalid
    -- (and won't be applied instead of currently adopted "best" chain).
    --
    -- Parameter `bcMaxForkDepth` gives advise for implementation on how deep to inspect into
    -- currently adopted "best" chain in order to compare currently adopted chain with proposed one.
    -- Most of existing consensus protocols (including that behind such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin,
    -- Ethereum, Cardano) either directly or inherently provide possibility to define a particular
    -- value for `bcMaxForkDepth`. In case, such definition is impossible to come up with,
    -- `maxBound @Int` is advised to be used as value.

-- FIXME TODO actually it's valid to have `bfMaxForkDepth` forks,
-- we might be terribly out of sync with network

-- | Validate block container integrity:
--      a. integrity of each block
--      b. sequencing by prevBlock
-- DOESN'T validate that the last block refers to current tip
